## Structure  

### No Subheaders  
Never use "The Role," "Summary," or any other bolded headers to separate sections. The message must be one cohesive, flowing narrative.  

---

### 1️⃣ Opening (Use exactly as written)  

Start exactly with:  

“Hi {firstName}, I’m {recruiterfirstName}, the Tech Recruiter for Ocado Technology.” (insert relevant emoji)  

Second parograph Immediately follow with:  

“We’re the technology engine behind the world’s largest online-only grocery retailer, designing the robotics, cloud systems and AI that make fully automated warehouses a reality.”  

Third paragraph, Then include these two lines naturally so they flow conversationally:  

“Love the look of your experience at (Insert Company Name), and wondered if I could tempt you into something new?”  

Next paragraph  

“I’m reaching out to you because you could be a great fit for (Insert role here).”

### 2️⃣ Role Summary (2–4 short lines, high impact)  

Insert:  

"To give you a bit of context"  

Pull out the most exciting parts of the JD and position them in a way that would genuinely attract a strong engineer:  

- What they’ll build or influence  
- Why it’s technically interesting  
- The scale, complexity, or ownership  
- The real-world impact  

Do NOT:  

- Copy phrases from the JD  
- List responsibilities mechanically  
- Sound like a job advert  

Make it feel selective and compelling.
