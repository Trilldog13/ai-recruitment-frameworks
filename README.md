Reusable AI prompt frameworks designed to reduce admin, improve consistency, and support smarter tech hiring.

# 🤖 AI Prompt Frameworks for Tech Recruitment  (for Gemini) ("Gems") 

Over the past 1/2 years, I’ve saved a huge amount of time using AI in tech recruitment.  

But I've also wasted time constantly rewriting prompts and tweaking outputs that weren’t consistent.  

What I needed was something more structured - prompts I could reuse that would consistently deliver the right outputs. 🔁  

So I spent time refining them properly.  

The result? A set of structured, reusable prompt frameworks designed to support the core parts of my workflow — from messy notes to polished outputs. 🧩  

These frameworks help with:  

- 📝 Turning rough intake notes into clear, structured briefs  
- 📩 Improving outreach messaging  
- 🎯 Screening candidates more objectively  
- 🗂 Structuring interview feedback  
- 🧠 Mapping talent markets  
- 📊 Creating more consistent, high-quality shortlists  

They’re not perfect (and still evolving). ⚙️  

I'll keep updating them in this Repo. 

They’ve deffo reduced admin time, improved consistency across the whole team, and freed me up to focus on what actually matters — conversations, relationships, and hiring quality. 🤝
